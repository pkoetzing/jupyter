## Contents:  

- Pandas ‘Series’ and ‘DataFrame’ objects 
- Retrieving market data from the MCP timeseries database 
- Slicing and dicing (aka indexing) 
- Basic statistics 
- Seasonality, regression and trends 
- Time adjustments and synchronization 
- Timeseries transformations and correlations 
- Basic data visualization with Matplotlib. 

## Expected outcome:

The course concept is “learning by doing” and we will do everything from within the “Jupyter Notebook” environment. The goal is to show how this toolset can facilitate ad-hoc data analysis and outperform Excel 97. 

## Target Audience/Prequisite knowledge:

Python knowledge is not expected, but we’ll touch upon some basic language concepts (loops, dictionaries) as we go.  

## Length:
6 hours
